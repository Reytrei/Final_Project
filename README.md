# Final_Project Studen NÂ°200580234 

Five files are attached with the whole work.
Final Project JN.ipynb -- Contains the whole script in python for the report.
R_Markdown.Rmd -- Contains the whole script in R for the report
Final_Project_Student200580234.pdf -- Contains the actual report for the course
Sample Script.Rmd -- Contains the script used to make the sample of the data
sampled_data.csv -- Contains the data for the whole coursework

I made a mistake when sampling the data and didn't set a Random Seed.  That is why I decided to attach also the data from the CSV file so anyone can reproduce it.
